# FB's 0b0t Kit Bot
 Automatic kit bot host for 0b0t.org
 
# Setting breakdown
Password - The customisable string of text you would like people to type in chat, to request a kit.

AutoSuicide - Automatically runs /kill when the bot teleports to a player.

Announce - Breaks down what the bot is currently doing, prints in chat but is only visible to you.

# How-to
Step 1 - Paste the code into a new module in your Phobos skid

Step 2 - Make sure there is a 1x2 space with a 3 block high roof for when your player jumps (look at the screenshot provided for help)

Step 3 - On one of the 2x1 space on the floor make sure one has a pressure plate connected to a DROPPER (not dispenser) and the dropper is connected to your stash via hoppers

Step 4 - Fill your stash with the desired kits

Step 5 - Set your spawn point in the bed, and rename the Password setting to whichever "password" you would like the kitbot to follow.

Step 6 - Turn on the module and advertise the fact you are running the bot.
